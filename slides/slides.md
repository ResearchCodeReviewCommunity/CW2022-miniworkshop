#### Code review at the time of publication

![](img/codecheck_logo.svg "A caption?")

. . .

What about code quality?

: : : notes

- Yesterday we had a presentation about CODECHECK. Code review at the
  time of publication. It's relevant for reproducibility and checking
  state of a codebase.
- But what if the code is unreadable/unmaintanable? It's too late for
  a rewrite.

#### Code review *during research*

![](img/pexels-christina-morillo-1181469.jpg ""){width=70%}

: : : notes

- There is a need for code review /during research/. A different kind
  of code review: informal, low-stakes and frequent. Something you
  would with colleagues once a week.
- Focus on code quality. Does not replace publication-time review -
  but is complementary.

#### Code Review benefits researchers themselves

- Learning and knowledge transfer
  - Dissemination of good practices.
  - Continuous peer learning.
- Collaboration
  - Group awareness, cohesion and trust
  - Makes it easier for people to join a team... and leave it.

: : : notes

- Code review during research has benefits beyond better code quality.
- Learning and knowledge transfer
  + Mentoring and dissemination of experience and good practices.
  + More experienced programmers are exposed to new patterns and
    approaches.
- Collaboration
  + Regular meetings and discussions increases group awareness, trust
    and cohesion.
  + Specific technical knowledge is spread. Easier for newcomers,
    reduce impact of leavers.

#### Code Review is common software practice...

... in the software industry and open source communities.

. . .

Code review is very rare in academia
- Lack of awareness
- Lack of guiddance
- Lack of incentives
- Lack of confidence

: : : notes

- Code review is common in the software industry and open source
  communities, but very rare in research.
- Lack of awareness and guidance on how to do code review in a
  research context. Most material out there is targeted at the
  software industry and open source projects.
- Establishment of code review culture will probably struggle with
  lack of incentives for code quality and lack of confidence.

#### CRC group 2

: : : notes

- UK/US based group of researchers and RSEs.
- Started as one of the working groups of the Code Review Community.
- GROUP PHOTO
- In practice, guidelines as website. Living document that is open to
  contributions.

#### Code review guidelines

Principles

- Suited for "lone coder".
- Short, and predictable time commitment.
- Informal and low stakes.
- Accessible to beginner programmers.

: : : notes

- Suited for lone, perhaps isolated, research developpers.
- Short, fixed duration. Can fit into a busy schedule with possiblity
  of iteration.
- Informal and low stakes.
- Accessible to less experienced programmers (e.g. resaercher how
  would not think of themselves as programmers).

#### Code review guidelines

The four steps

1. Find a reviewer
2. Meet and agree on objectives
3. Perform code review
4. Finalise
